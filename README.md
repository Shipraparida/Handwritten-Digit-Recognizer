## About the Project

This repository provides a complete pipeline for **handwritten digit recognition**:

1. **Data Loading** – Uses the MNIST dataset containing 28x28 grayscale images of digits 0–9.  
2. **Preprocessing** – Normalizes and reshapes images for the CNN model.  
3. **Model Training** – A Convolutional Neural Network is trained to classify digits accurately.  
4. **Prediction** – Once trained, the model can predict handwritten digits from new images.  

Ideal for students, developers, and researchers interested in **computer vision**, **deep learning**, and **image classification tasks**.
